### Etsy SEO Tips (value-first, no product mention needed)

1. Etsy SEO tip: Use all 13 tag slots on every listing. ~30% of sellers don't. That's free ranking potential you're leaving on the table.

2. Your Etsy title is the #1 ranking factor. But here's the thing — only the first 40 characters show on mobile. Front-load your most important keyword.

3. Stop using single-word Etsy tags. "Necklace" competes with 5 million listings. "Dainty gold layered necklace" competes with thousands. Long-tail wins.

4. Etsy SEO mistake I see constantly: repeating title words in tags. Your title is already indexed. Use tags for search terms that AREN'T in your title.

5. Etsy's algorithm gives a small boost to recently updated listings. Even small edits (tweaking a tag, updating the description) can help.

6. Etsy categories and attributes are search signals most sellers ignore. Being in the wrong category means fighting uphill no matter how good your tags are.

7. The best Etsy tag research method: look at what top sellers in your niche actually use. Don't guess — observe what's already working.

### Builder / Indie Hacker Updates

8. Shipped a new feature for Etsy Edge this week: [feature]. The #1 user request. Building in public means your roadmap writes itself.

9. Week [X] metrics for Etsy Edge: [installs] installs, [paid] paid users, $[MRR] MRR. Here's what's working and what isn't.

10. Lesson from building a Chrome extension: the free tier IS the marketing. Tag Spy (free) gets installs. Some fraction convert to Pro. Simple funnel.

11. The hardest part of building a tool for Etsy sellers isn't the code. It's distribution. Getting in front of the right people at the right time.

12. I spent 3 months building features. Should have spent 3 weeks building + 2 months distributing. Distribution > product, every time.

### Data Insights

13. I looked at the top 50 listings for "handmade candles." Every single one uses all 13 tags. Not one exception.

14. Interesting pattern: top Etsy sellers rarely use tags that exactly match their title. They use tags to capture adjacent search queries.

15. The most common tag pattern among top sellers: [adjective] + [material] + [product type]. Example: "vintage brass candleholder."

16. Average tag length among top-performing Etsy listings: 2.8 words. Single-word tags are almost never used by top sellers.

### User Wins / Social Proof

17. A seller DM'd me saying they went from page 4 to page 1 after rewriting their tags based on competitor research. The basics work.

18. "I had no idea I was only using 8 out of 13 tags." — This is the most common reaction when sellers first use Tag Spy. Easy wins are everywhere.

19. Best feedback I've gotten: "I learned more about Etsy SEO from spending 10 minutes with Tag Spy than from reading 5 blog posts."

20. Every week I get DMs from sellers saying they didn't know Etsy tags were visible in the page source. The demand for this tool validates itself.
