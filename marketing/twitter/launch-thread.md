# Twitter/X Launch Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I built a free Chrome extension that shows you the hidden tags on any Etsy listing.

It took me a weekend to build. Here's the story and what I learned about Etsy SEO 🧵

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
My partner sells on Etsy. Her biggest frustration: figuring out what tags to use.

She'd look at top sellers' listings trying to guess their tags. Open page source. Google "best Etsy tags for [niche]."

The irony? Etsy includes tags in the page's structured data. They're public. Just hidden.

**Tweet 3 (Solution):**
So I built Etsy Edge — a Chrome extension that surfaces those tags in a clean panel.

Browse any Etsy listing → see all 13 tags instantly.

No account needed. No separate dashboard. Just browse Etsy and the data is right there.

Free forever.

**Tweet 4 (What I learned):**
After analyzing hundreds of top listings, patterns emerged:

→ Almost all use the full 13 tags
→ Multi-word phrases beat single words
→ Best sellers don't repeat title words in tags
→ First 40 characters of the title carry the most SEO weight

**Tweet 5 (Pro features):**
The free version shows tags + gives an SEO score (A-F grade).

For sellers who want more, Pro ($9.99/mo) adds:
→ AI tag suggestions (13 optimized tags with reasoning)
→ Competitor analysis (see tag frequency across top 20 listings)

**Tweet 6 (CTA):**
If you sell on Etsy (or know someone who does), try the free Tag Spy:

And if you're building tools for niche audiences, I'm happy to share what I've learned about the process. DMs open.
