# Facebook Target Groups

## How to Find Groups
1. Search Facebook for: "Etsy sellers", "Etsy SEO", "Etsy tips", "handmade sellers"
2. Filter by Groups
3. Sort by member count and recent activity
4. Look for groups with 5k+ members and recent posts (within last 24 hours)

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Size**: 5k-100k+ members (too small = not worth it, too big = posts get buried)
- **Activity**: Multiple posts per day from different members
- **Quality**: Are members asking real questions? Or is it all spam/self-promo?
- **Rules**: Do they allow tool mentions? Some do, some don't
- **Admin activity**: Active admins = better quality, but stricter rules
