## Post Template A: Value-First (for groups that allow tool mentions)

**Post:**

Quick tip that's helped me a lot with Etsy SEO research 👇

Did you know you can see the tags on any Etsy listing? Etsy includes them in the page's structured data, but they're hidden from the normal listing view.

Why this matters: You can look at exactly what top sellers in your niche are tagging their listings with, then use that to inform your own tag strategy.

A few things I've noticed from looking at hundreds of top listings:
- Almost all of them use all 13 tags
- They use multi-word phrases, not single words
- They don't repeat title words in their tags
- Their most important keyword is in the first 40 characters of the title

I built a free Chrome extension (Etsy Edge) that shows the tags right on the listing page if you don't want to dig through page source. But you can also just right-click → View Source → search for "tags" on any listing.

Hope this helps someone! Happy to answer Etsy SEO questions.

## Post Template B: Question Angle (for groups that ban self-promo)

**Post:**

What's your process for researching Etsy tags?

I've been doing a deep dive on SEO for my shop and I'm curious how other sellers figure out what tags to use. Do you:
- Look at what competitors are using?
- Use a keyword tool?
- Just brainstorm and hope for the best?

I've found that looking at the tags on top-performing listings in my niche has been the most helpful approach. Would love to hear what works for you.

*(Only share the tool in a reply if someone asks what tool you use or how you see competitor tags)*
