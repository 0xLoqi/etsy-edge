**Title**: I built a Chrome extension for Etsy sellers as a side project. Here's what I've learned so far about building tools for small business owners.

**Body**:

My partner sells handmade jewelry on Etsy, and I'm a developer. I kept watching her spend hours trying to figure out what tags to use on her listings. She'd look at competitors' listings, try to guess what tags they were using, Google "best Etsy tags for jewelry"... it was painful.

So I built a Chrome extension that just shows you the tags. Turns out Etsy includes them in the page's structured data — they're public, just not displayed in the UI. One weekend of coding and suddenly she could see exactly what every top seller was tagging their listings with.

That turned into a bigger project: an SEO scorer, AI-powered tag suggestions, competitor analysis. I called it Etsy Edge and put it on the Chrome Web Store.

**Things I've learned building tools for small business owners:**

1. **Free gets you in the door.** The tag-viewing feature is free and always will be. It's genuinely useful on its own, and it's what gets people to try the extension. The paid features (AI suggestions, competitor analysis) are for people who want to go deeper.

2. **Small business owners are skeptical of new tools** — and rightfully so. They've been burned by tools that promise the world and deliver nothing. I found that being transparent about what the tool does and doesn't do builds more trust than any marketing copy.

3. **"Good enough" ships, "perfect" doesn't.** I spent way too long polishing features before launching. The feedback I've gotten from actual users has been 10x more valuable than any assumption I made while building.

4. **Niche is good.** I could have tried to build a general "SEO tool." Instead I built specifically for Etsy sellers who want to optimize tags. The focus makes the product better and the marketing easier.

Still early days — just launched and figuring out distribution. But it's been a fun ride building something that solves a real problem I watched someone struggle with.

Anyone else building tools for small business owners? Would love to hear what you've learned.
