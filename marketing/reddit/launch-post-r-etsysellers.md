**Title**: I built a free Chrome extension that shows you the hidden tags on any Etsy listing — looking for beta testers

**Body**:

Hey everyone! I'm a developer and my partner sells on Etsy, so I've been learning about Etsy SEO. One thing that frustrated me was that you can't easily see what tags other sellers are using on their listings — the data is there in the page source, but who wants to dig through HTML?

So I built **Etsy Edge**, a free Chrome extension that shows you the tags on any Etsy listing in a little overlay panel. You just browse to a listing and the tags appear automatically.

**What it does (free):**
- **Tag Spy** — See all 13 tags on any listing, right on the page
- **SEO Score** — Get an instant A-F grade for any listing based on tag count, title optimization, description, and tag diversity

**What it does (paid, $9.99/mo):**
- **AI Tag Suggestions** — Get 13 AI-optimized tags generated for your specific listing
- **Competitor Analysis** — See which tags the top 20 listings use for any keyword, with frequency data

The free version is genuinely useful on its own — I use Tag Spy constantly just to see what's working in different niches.

**Looking for feedback on:**
- Is the SEO scoring useful? Are the grades accurate to what you'd expect?
- Is the Tag Spy overlay in a good position or does it get in the way?
- For those who try Pro — are the AI suggestions actually good?

Happy to answer any questions. This is a real side project, not a big company — your feedback genuinely shapes what I build next.
