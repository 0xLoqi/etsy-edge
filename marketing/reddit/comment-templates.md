## When someone asks about Etsy tags / how to find good tags

> Tags are one of the most important ranking factors on Etsy, but the tricky part is figuring out what to use. What I've found works well is looking at what top sellers in your niche are actually tagging their listings with — you can see them in the page source, or there are tools that surface them for you. Focus on multi-word phrases (2-4 words) that match how buyers search, and make sure you're using all 13 slots.

*(Only mention Etsy Edge if someone directly asks for a tool recommendation)*

## When someone asks "what tools do you use for Etsy SEO?"

> I use a combination of things. Etsy's own search analytics in the Shop Manager is underrated — it shows you exactly what terms people are finding you for. For competitive research, I use a Chrome extension called Etsy Edge that shows the tags on any listing (the free version does this). eRank is solid too for keyword research. Honestly, the biggest wins come from just using all 13 tags, making them multi-word phrases, and front-loading your title with the most important keyword.

## When someone posts about low traffic / no sales

> Low traffic usually comes down to one of a few things: (1) not using all 13 tags, (2) tags are too broad (single words with huge competition), (3) title doesn't have keywords in the first 40 characters, or (4) your category/attributes aren't set right. Before looking at anything else, I'd audit those basics. You'd be surprised how many listings leave easy SEO wins on the table.

*(Don't mention any tools unless asked — just be helpful)*

## When someone asks about eRank / Marmalead / other tools

> eRank is great for keyword research and tracking. Marmalead has solid data too but it's pricier. If you mainly want to see what tags competitors are using, there's a free Chrome extension called Etsy Edge that shows tags right on the listing page — no separate dashboard needed. Really depends on what you're looking for though. What's your main goal with the tool?

## When someone shares their shop for feedback

> [Give genuine, specific feedback on their actual listings first — tags, titles, photos, descriptions. Be helpful.]

One thing I'd check is whether you're using all 13 tags on each listing, and whether they're multi-word phrases. I looked at your [specific listing] and [specific observation about their tags/title]. That's an easy win that could help with search visibility.

## General rules for Reddit comments:
- **Be genuinely helpful first.** The comment should be valuable even if they never click a link.
- **Don't mention Etsy Edge unless it's directly relevant** to what they're asking.
- **Never use marketing language** like "check out" or "you should try" — just mention it naturally.
- **Engage in the conversation.** Ask follow-up questions. Be a person, not a marketer.
- **One mention per thread maximum.** If you've already mentioned the tool, don't bring it up again in the same thread.
