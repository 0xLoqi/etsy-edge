**Title**: I analyzed the tags on 500+ top-selling Etsy listings. Here's what I found.

**Body**:

I've been deep in Etsy SEO research for a side project and wanted to share some patterns I noticed after looking at hundreds of top-performing listings across different niches.

**Key findings:**

1. **Almost every top listing uses all 13 tags.** This sounds obvious, but I found that ~30% of listings in the first 3 pages of search results don't use all their tag slots. Free ranking potential left on the table.

2. **Multi-word phrases dominate.** The best sellers almost never use single-word tags. Instead of "necklace" they use "gold layered necklace" or "dainty necklace gift." Etsy matches tags as phrases, so longer tags = more specific matches = less competition.

3. **Top sellers don't repeat title words in their tags.** Your title is already indexed for search. Using tags to repeat what's in your title wastes slots. The best listings use tags to capture search terms that *aren't* in the title.

4. **The first 40 characters of the title carry the most weight.** On mobile (where most Etsy shopping happens), only the first ~40 characters show. Top sellers front-load their most important keywords there.

5. **Category and attributes matter more than people think.** Etsy uses your selected category and attributes as additional search signals. A listing in the wrong category is fighting an uphill battle regardless of tags.

6. **Listings get refreshed regularly.** Many top sellers renew or update their listings periodically. Etsy's algorithm gives a small boost to recently updated listings.

**How to apply this:**

- Go through your listings and make sure every one uses all 13 tags
- Rewrite tags as 2-4 word phrases that match how buyers actually search
- Audit your titles — put your most valuable keyword in the first 40 characters
- Check that your category and attributes are set correctly

I actually built a free Chrome extension called Etsy Edge that lets you see the tags on any listing while you browse (the tags are in the page data, they're just not shown in the UI). It's been helpful for researching what competitors are doing. Happy to share the link if anyone's interested.

Hope this helps someone. Happy to answer questions about what I found.
