# Product Hunt Hunter Outreach

## What is a Hunter?
A "hunter" is the person who submits your product to Product Hunt. Being hunted by someone with a following gives you more visibility than self-posting.

## Ideal Hunters to Contact
Look for hunters who have previously hunted:
- Chrome extensions
- SEO tools
- E-commerce tools
- Small business tools
- AI-powered tools

## How to Find Hunters
1. Go to producthunt.com and search for similar products (eRank, SEO tools, Chrome extensions)
2. Note who hunted those products
3. Check their profile — hunters with 500+ followers are ideal
4. Look at their Twitter — active hunters often tweet about products they're interested in

## Outreach Template

**Subject**: Quick question — would you hunt an Etsy SEO extension?

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

I saw you hunted [similar product] on Product Hunt — nice pick. I'm building something in a similar space and wanted to see if you'd be interested in hunting it.

**Etsy Edge** is a free Chrome extension that reveals the hidden tags on any Etsy listing. It also has AI-powered tag suggestions and competitor analysis for Pro users.

What makes it different: Tag Spy (seeing any listing's tags) is completely free, and it works right on the Etsy page — no separate dashboard.

Would you be open to taking a look? Happy to give you a walkthrough or just send the extension link.

[Your name]

## Timeline
- Reach out to hunters 2-3 weeks before your planned launch date
- If no one bites, self-hunting is fine — many successful products self-hunt
- Having a genuine product with a clear value prop matters more than the hunter
