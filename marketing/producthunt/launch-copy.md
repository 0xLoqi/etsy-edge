## Maker's First Comment

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built Etsy Edge because my partner sells on Etsy and I kept watching her struggle to figure out what tags to use. She'd open competitors' listings, view page source, try to find the tags in the HTML... it was painful.

Turns out Etsy includes tags in the page's structured data — they're public, just not shown in the UI. So I built a Chrome extension that surfaces them in a clean overlay panel.

**What's free (forever):**
- Tag Spy — see all 13 tags on any Etsy listing
- SEO Score — instant A-F grade based on tag count, title optimization, description, and tag diversity

**What's Pro ($9.99/mo):**
- AI Tag Suggestions — GPT-4o-mini generates 13 optimized tags for your listing with reasoning
- Competitor Analysis — see which tags the top 20 listings use for any keyword

The free version is genuinely useful on its own. I use Tag Spy every day just to browse niches and see what's working.

Would love your feedback — what would make this more useful? What am I missing?
