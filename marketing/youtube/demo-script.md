## Script

### INTRO (0:00-0:30)
"If you sell on Etsy, you know how important tags are for getting found in search. But here's the thing — you can't normally see what tags other sellers are using. You can see their title, their photos, their description... but not their tags.

What if you could see the exact tags on any listing? That's what I'm going to show you today."

### TAG SPY DEMO (0:30-1:30)
*(Screen recording: Navigate to a popular Etsy listing)*

"So here I am on a regular Etsy listing. I've installed Etsy Edge — it's a free Chrome extension. And you can see this panel in the bottom-right corner.

This is Tag Spy. It shows me all 13 tags this seller is using on this listing.

*(Point out interesting tags)*

Notice how they're using multi-word phrases, not single words. 'Vintage brass candle holder' not just 'candle.' That's because Etsy matches tags as phrases — more specific tags mean less competition.

I can do this on any Etsy listing. Just browse to it and the tags appear. Let me show you another one...

*(Navigate to another listing)*

Same thing — all 13 tags, right there. This is incredibly useful for research. You can browse your top competitors and see exactly what they're tagging."

### SEO SCORE (1:30-2:15)
"The extension also gives you an SEO score. See this grade right here?

It scores based on five factors:
- Are you using all 13 tags?
- Is your title the right length?
- Are your most important keywords in the first 40 characters?
- Is your description long enough?
- Are your tags diverse (not overlapping)?

This listing gets a [grade] because [reason]. If I go to a listing that's not as well optimized...

*(Navigate to a less-optimized listing)*

You can see the score drops because [specific reason]. This gives you an instant read on what needs fixing."

### AI SUGGESTIONS (2:15-3:15)
"Now here's the Pro feature that I think is really powerful — AI tag suggestions.

*(Click on AI Suggest tab)*

When I click 'Generate Suggestions,' the AI analyzes this listing's title, description, and what competitors in this niche are using, and generates 13 optimized tags.

*(Show the suggestions loading and appearing)*

Each tag comes with a reason — it tells you WHY it suggested that tag. So you're not just getting tags, you're learning what makes a good tag.

These are based on GPT-4o-mini, specifically trained for Etsy SEO best practices."

### COMPETITOR ANALYSIS (3:15-3:45)
"The other Pro feature is competitor analysis. You type in a keyword, and it analyzes the tags across the top 20 listings for that search term.

*(Show competitor analysis)*

It shows you which tags appear most frequently. If 15 out of 20 top sellers are using a specific tag — that's probably a tag you should be using too."

### OUTRO (3:45-4:15)
"That's Etsy Edge. Tag Spy and the SEO score are completely free — no account needed, no credit card. The AI suggestions and competitor analysis are $9.99 a month if you want to go deeper.

Link to install it is in the description. If this was helpful, drop a comment and let me know what Etsy SEO topics you want me to cover next."
