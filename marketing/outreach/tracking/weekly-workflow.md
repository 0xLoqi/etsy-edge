# Weekly Outreach Workflow

**Time commitment:** ~30 minutes per week
**Goal:** 5 new pitches + 5 follow-ups per week

## Weekly Schedule

### Monday (15 minutes) -- Research and Queue

**Find 5 new contacts.**

1. Open `tracking/tracker.csv` and check how many contacts you have queued (no "Date Contacted" yet).
2. If fewer than 5 are queued, spend 10 minutes finding new ones:
   - Pick one search query from the finding guides (`finding-bloggers.md`, `finding-youtubers.md`, or `finding-newsletters.md`).
   - Run the search, open top results.
   - Evaluate each using the Must-Have criteria in the guide.
   - Add qualified contacts to `tracker.csv` with name, platform, URL, and email. Leave Date Contacted blank.
3. Pick the 5 most promising contacts from your queue for this week's pitches.
4. For each one, note which template to use in the "Template Used" column (but don't fill in Date Contacted yet).

**Time: ~15 minutes**

### Wednesday (10 minutes) -- Send Pitches

**Send 5 personalized pitches.**

1. Open `tracker.csv` and find your 5 contacts for this week.
2. For each contact:
   - Open their site/channel/newsletter in a browser tab.
   - Find one specific thing to reference (a post title, video, or newsletter issue).
   - Open the appropriate email template.
   - Fill in all personalization fields (see the checklist in each template).
   - Send the email.
   - Update `tracker.csv`: fill in Date Contacted with today's date.
3. Average 2 minutes per email = 10 minutes total.

**Time: ~10 minutes**

### Friday (5 minutes) -- Follow-Ups

**Follow up on pitches from 5-7 days ago.**

1. Open `tracker.csv`.
2. Filter for contacts where:
   - Date Contacted is 5-7 days ago
   - Response column is empty or blank
   - You haven't already followed up
3. For each one:
   - Reply to the original email thread.
   - Use one of the follow-up templates from `follow-up.md`.
   - Update `tracker.csv`: note "Followed up [date]" in the Notes column.
4. Also check for any responses that came in during the week:
   - If someone replied positively, respond immediately (send Pro code, answer questions, etc.).
   - Update the Response column in `tracker.csv`.

**Time: ~5 minutes**

## Tracking Instructions

### How to Use tracker.csv

### Response Handling

| They say... | You do... |
|---|---|
| "Yes, I'd love to try it" | Send Pro access code immediately. Offer to do a quick walkthrough call. |
| "How does it work?" | Send a 2-3 sentence explanation + link to the extension page. Offer a call. |
| "Do you have an affiliate program?" | If yes, share details. If no, say "Not yet but I'm noting interest -- I'll reach out when we launch one." |
| "I'm busy right now" | Reply: "No rush at all. The offer stands whenever you're ready." Mark in tracker to revisit in 1 month. |
| "Not interested" | Reply: "Thanks for letting me know! All the best." Mark as closed in tracker. |
| No response after follow-up | Mark "No response" in tracker. Revisit in 3 months. |

### Monthly Review (10 minutes, first Monday of each month)

At the start of each month, review your tracker:

1. **Count your numbers:**
   - How many pitches sent this month?
   - How many responses received?
   - How many reviews/mentions published?
   - What's your response rate? (Target: 15-25%)

2. **Identify what's working:**
   - Which template gets the most responses?
   - Which platform (blog, YouTube, newsletter) converts best?
   - What personalization approaches get replies?

3. **Adjust for next month:**
   - If response rate is under 10%, review your personalization. Are you actually reading their content first?
   - If bloggers respond but YouTubers don't, shift more effort to bloggers.
   - If a specific template isn't working, tweak the subject line or value proposition.

4. **Revisit old contacts:**
   - Check for anyone marked "revisit in 3 months" whose 3 months is up.
   - Move them back into the queue with a fresh pitch angle.
