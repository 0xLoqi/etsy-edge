## Email Body

Hi [FIRST NAME],

I found your article "[EXACT POST TITLE]" while researching Etsy SEO tools -- it's a really solid roundup, and I've shared it with a few sellers I know.

I recently launched Etsy Edge, a Chrome extension that I think would be a strong addition to the list. Here's what makes it different from the tools you've already covered:

**What it does:**
- **Tag Spy (free):** Reveals the hidden tags on any Etsy listing -- including competitors. No other free tool does this directly in the browser.
- **SEO Score (free):** Instant A-F grade on any listing's tag optimization with specific feedback.
- **AI Tag Suggestions (Pro, $9.99/mo):** GPT-4o-mini analyzes a listing and recommends better tags based on search volume and relevance.
- **Competitor Analysis (Pro):** See what tags the top 20 listings use for any search term.

**Why it fits your list:**
- Free tier is genuinely useful (not a bait-and-switch trial)
- Works directly in the browser -- no separate dashboard to learn
- Solves a specific pain point (finding and optimizing tags) that your other listed tools don't fully cover
- New entrant, so your readers likely haven't heard of it yet

**What I can provide for the write-up:**
- Feature summary in whatever format you prefer
- Screenshots (browser extension in action, SEO score panel, tag suggestions)
- Pricing details
- Comparison notes vs. other tools if helpful

Here's the extension page: https://etsyedge.app/

I'd also be happy to give you free Pro access so you can try it firsthand before deciding.

Thanks for considering it -- and for maintaining such a useful resource for Etsy sellers.

## Key Differentiators to Emphasize (pick the most relevant)

Use these when comparing to tools they've already listed:

| If they list... | Emphasize that Etsy Edge... |
|---|---|
| eRank | Shows tags directly on Etsy (no separate site), free tag viewing |
| Marmalead | Lower price point, browser-native experience |
| Sale Samurai | AI-powered suggestions (GPT-4o-mini), not just data |
| EtsyHunt | Free tier with real functionality, not just a trial |
| Generic SEO tools | Built specifically for Etsy, understands Etsy's tag system |

## Notes

- Roundup posts are high-value SEO pages. Authors maintain them because they drive traffic. They're usually open to adding good tools.
- Check when the post was last updated. If it hasn't been updated in 2+ years, the author may have moved on.
- If the post has affiliate links, mention you have (or will have) an affiliate program if applicable.
- These authors often have multiple roundup posts. Check if they also have posts about Etsy SEO, Etsy tips, etc., and mention those too.
