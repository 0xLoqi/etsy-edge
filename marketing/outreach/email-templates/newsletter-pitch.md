## Email Body

Hi [FIRST NAME],

I've been reading [NEWSLETTER NAME] for a while -- [SPECIFIC DETAIL, e.g., "your issue on Etsy's Q4 algorithm changes was the most practical breakdown I've seen"]. Your readers clearly trust your recommendations.

I built Etsy Edge, a Chrome extension that lets Etsy sellers see the hidden tags on any listing. The free version shows all 13 tags + an A-F SEO score. Pro ($9.99/mo) adds AI-powered tag suggestions and competitor analysis.

I'd love to offer your subscribers an **exclusive deal** -- either:
- **First month of Pro free** (unique code just for your list)
- **50% off the first 3 months** (your choice)

The free tier alone is genuinely useful (Tag Spy + SEO Score, no signup required), so even readers who don't upgrade get value from the mention.

If this sounds like a fit for an upcoming issue, I'm happy to provide:
- A short blurb you can edit however you want
- Screenshots or a quick GIF walkthrough
- Your exclusive discount code
- Answers to any questions

No pressure at all. If the timing isn't right or it's not a fit, I completely understand.

Thanks for the great newsletter.

[YOUR NAME]

## Notes

- Newsletter authors get pitched constantly. Keep this short. They'll skim it in 30 seconds.
- The exclusive discount code is the hook -- it gives them something unique for their audience.
- If they have a paid newsletter, acknowledge that and position this as free value for their subscribers.
- If they have a "recommendations" or "tools" section in their newsletter, reference it specifically.
- Substack authors often have their email in their profile. Beehiiv authors sometimes list it in the footer.
