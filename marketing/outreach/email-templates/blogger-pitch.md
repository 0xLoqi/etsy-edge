## Email Body

Hi [FIRST NAME],

I came across your post on [SPECIFIC POST TITLE/TOPIC] and really appreciated [SPECIFIC DETAIL -- e.g., "the breakdown of how long-tail keywords outperform generic tags"]. It's clear you actually understand what Etsy sellers deal with day to day.

I built Etsy Edge, a Chrome extension that shows sellers the hidden tags on any Etsy listing -- including competitor listings. Sellers click on any product, and the extension instantly reveals all 13 tags, gives an A-F SEO score, and (on Pro) suggests AI-generated tag improvements.

Here's why I think your audience would care:

- **Tag Spy is completely free.** No signup, no credit card. Install and immediately see hidden tags on any listing.
- **The SEO Score (also free)** gives sellers instant A-F feedback on their own listings so they know where to focus.
- **Pro ($9.99/mo)** adds AI tag suggestions powered by GPT-4o-mini and competitor analysis across the top 20 listings for any search term.

I'd love to offer you **free Pro access** so you can try it yourself and see if it's worth sharing with your readers. No obligations -- if it's not a fit, no worries at all.

If you're interested, I can send you a Pro access code and a quick walkthrough of the features. Happy to answer any questions or hop on a quick call if that's easier.

Thanks for your time, and keep up the great content.

[YOUR NAME]

P.S. Here's the extension if you want to take a look first: https://etsyedge.app/

## Personalization Checklist

Before sending, make sure you've filled in:

- [ ] Their first name
- [ ] A specific post title or topic they wrote about
- [ ] A specific detail from that post (proves you actually read it)
- [ ] Your name and any relevant credential (e.g., "I'm an Etsy seller myself" if true)

## Notes

- Never send this as a mass email. Each one should feel like a 1:1 message.
- If their blog has a contact form instead of an email, use the form but keep the same structure.
- Send Tuesday through Thursday, 9-11 AM in their timezone if possible.
- If they have a podcast too, mention it. Shows you did your homework.
