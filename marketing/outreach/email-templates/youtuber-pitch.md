## Email Body

Hi [FIRST NAME],

I just watched your video on [SPECIFIC VIDEO TITLE] -- [SPECIFIC COMPLIMENT, e.g., "the side-by-side comparison of optimized vs. unoptimized listings was super clear"]. Your viewers are lucky to have someone breaking this stuff down so well.

I built Etsy Edge, a Chrome extension for Etsy sellers, and I think it could make for a really engaging video segment (or even a standalone video). Here's why:

**It's extremely visual.** When you click on any Etsy listing, the extension instantly reveals the hidden tags that Etsy normally hides. Your viewers would literally see the "secret" tags behind top-selling listings in real time. It also shows an A-F SEO score with color-coded feedback -- great for screen recordings.

The free version alone gives your viewers immediate value:
- **Tag Spy:** See all 13 hidden tags on any listing (competitors included)
- **SEO Score:** Instant A-F grade on any listing's tag optimization

Pro ($9.99/mo) adds:
- **AI Tag Suggestions:** GPT-4o-mini analyzes a listing and recommends better tags
- **Competitor Analysis:** See what tags the top 20 listings use for any search term

**What I'm offering:**
- Free Pro access for you (permanent, no strings attached)
- A **discount code for your viewers** (I can do first month free or 50% off -- your call)
- Happy to do a quick walkthrough call so you can see the best demo flow
- I can provide any screenshots, feature lists, or talking points you need

No script requirements, no approval process. You'd have complete creative control.

Would you be interested in checking it out? I can send a Pro code right away.

[YOUR NAME]

## Personalization Checklist

- [ ] Their first name
- [ ] A specific recent video title
- [ ] A specific compliment about that video (proves you watched it)
- [ ] Your name
- [ ] Decide on the discount offer before sending (first month free vs. percentage off)

## Why This Works for YouTubers Specifically

- Emphasizes the visual/demo aspect -- YouTubers need content that looks good on screen
- Offers a discount code for their audience -- gives them exclusive value to offer viewers
- Mentions "no script requirements" -- creators hate feeling controlled
- Suggests a walkthrough call -- lowers the effort barrier for them to understand the tool
- The "hidden tags reveal" is inherently satisfying to watch -- good thumbnail/hook material

## Notes

- Find their email in the YouTube "About" tab or channel description. Don't use YouTube comments for pitches.
- If they have under 5K subscribers, they're more likely to respond. Don't ignore small channels.
- If they've done sponsored content before, they already understand the format. Mention you noticed their past collabs.
- Send Tuesday through Thursday. Avoid weekends.
