## Email Body (Version A -- Standard Follow-Up)

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Just bumping this to the top of your inbox in case it got buried. I know things get busy.

The short version: Etsy Edge is a free Chrome extension that reveals hidden tags on any Etsy listing. I'd love to give you free Pro access to try it out. No obligations.

Happy to answer any questions if you're interested.

## Email Body (Version B -- Add New Info)

Use this version if you have something new to share (a new feature, a milestone, press mention, etc.).

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Following up on my note from last week about Etsy Edge. Wanted to share a quick update -- [NEW INFO, e.g., "we just crossed 500 installs" or "we added a new competitor analysis feature" or "an Etsy seller posted a review calling it their favorite new tool"].

Still happy to set you up with free Pro access if you'd like to check it out. No strings attached.

## Email Body (Version C -- Final Attempt, Very Brief)

Use this only if you've already sent Version A or B and want one last try. Most of the time, skip this and move on.

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Last note from me on this -- don't want to clutter your inbox. If Etsy Edge ever becomes relevant for your [blog/channel/newsletter], the offer for free Pro access stands. Just reply anytime.

All the best,
[YOUR NAME]

## Rules for Follow-Ups

1. **One follow-up only.** Do not send more than one follow-up per person unless they responded positively but the conversation stalled.
2. **Wait 5-7 days.** Not 2 days, not 14 days. 5-7 is the sweet spot.
3. **Keep it short.** The follow-up should be 3-5 sentences max. If the original pitch didn't grab them, a longer follow-up won't help.
4. **Reply to the original thread.** Don't start a new email chain.
5. **Don't guilt-trip.** No "I noticed you didn't respond" or "I'm sure you're busy but...". Just be direct and brief.
6. **Add value if possible.** A new data point or update makes the follow-up feel less like nagging.
7. **No response after follow-up = move on.** Mark them in the tracker as "No Response" and revisit in 3 months if relevant.
