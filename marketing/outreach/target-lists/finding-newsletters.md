### Other Discovery Methods

1. **Check blogger and YouTuber sites.** Many of the bloggers and YouTubers you find in the other guides also run newsletters. Look for signup forms on their sites.
2. **Twitter/X search.** Search `"etsy newsletter"` or `"new issue" "etsy"` on Twitter. Newsletter authors often promote new issues there.
3. **Facebook Groups.** Join 2-3 Etsy seller Facebook groups. Members often share newsletters they read. Note these down.
4. **Newsletter directories:**
   - https://newsletterhunt.com -- search for "etsy" or "ecommerce"
   - https://www.newsletterstack.com -- browse business/ecommerce categories
   - https://letterlist.com -- curated newsletter recommendations

## How to Evaluate a Newsletter

### Must-Have Criteria

- [ ] **Sent an issue in the last 30 days.** Dead newsletters waste your time.
- [ ] **Focused on Etsy or ecommerce selling.** Not just a general business newsletter that mentioned Etsy once.
- [ ] **Has a way to contact the author.** Reply-to address, website contact form, or social media.

### Metrics to Look For

Most newsletter authors don't publicly share subscriber counts, but you can estimate:

- **Substack:** Check if they show "subscriber" or "reader" counts on their profile. Some Substacks show "X subscribers" publicly.
- **Social proof:** Check their signup page for claims like "Join 5,000 sellers" or similar.
- **Social media following:** A newsletter author with 5K+ Twitter followers likely has a decent list.
- **Engagement proxies:** Do their posts/issues get comments, likes, or shares? On Substack, check the comment count on recent issues.

### Size Tiers

| Estimated Subscribers | Approach |
|---|---|
| Under 500 | Very responsive. Offer free Pro access. They'll appreciate the partnership. |
| 500 - 2,000 | Good sweet spot. Offer exclusive discount code for readers. |
| 2,000 - 10,000 | May want compensation or affiliate deal. Still worth pitching with discount code offer. |
| 10,000+ | Long shot for a free mention. May need paid placement. Pitch anyway. |

### Strong Signals (Pitch These First)

- They have a "tools" or "recommendations" section in their newsletter
- They've mentioned other Etsy tools before
- They accept reader suggestions or tips
- The newsletter is specifically about Etsy (not general ecommerce)
- They're a small/growing newsletter (more receptive to partnerships)

### Red Flags (Skip These)

- No issue published in 60+ days
- Newsletter is pure promotional content (selling their own course/product)
- No reply mechanism or contact info
- Content is entirely AI-generated filler
- They only recommend products through affiliate links with no genuine assessment

## Where to Find Contact Info

1. **Reply to a recent issue.** Most newsletters allow replies. Subscribe, wait for the next issue, and reply to it with your pitch. This is often the most effective method.
2. **Substack profile:** Author's email is sometimes visible on their Substack About page.
3. **Their website:** If they link to a personal site or blog, check the contact page.
4. **Social media:** Twitter/X DMs or Instagram DMs work if they're active there.
5. **LinkedIn:** Some newsletter authors list their email on LinkedIn or accept InMail.

### Best Practice: Subscribe First

Before pitching any newsletter author:
1. Subscribe to their newsletter (free tier).
2. Read at least 2-3 issues.
3. Reference something specific from a recent issue in your pitch.
4. This takes 10 minutes and dramatically increases your response rate.

## Building Your List

### Process

1. Spend 30 minutes running the searches above.
2. Subscribe to every relevant newsletter you find (use a dedicated email if you want to keep things organized).
3. After reading 2-3 issues of each, evaluate using the criteria above.
4. Add qualified newsletters to `tracking/tracker.csv`.
5. Aim for 5-8 qualified newsletters per research session.

### Prioritization Order

1. **Tier 1:** Etsy-specific newsletters that recommend tools. Use `newsletter-pitch.md`.
2. **Tier 2:** Etsy-focused newsletters without a tools section. Use `newsletter-pitch.md` and position as reader value.
3. **Tier 3:** General ecommerce newsletters that cover Etsy. Use `newsletter-pitch.md` with extra context on why Etsy sellers in their audience would care.
