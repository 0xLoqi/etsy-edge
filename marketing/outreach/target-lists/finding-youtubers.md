## How to Evaluate a YouTube Channel

### Must-Have Criteria

- [ ] **Uploaded in the last 3 months.** Dead channels won't post your content.
- [ ] **At least 5 Etsy-related videos.** One-off Etsy videos don't indicate a niche creator.
- [ ] **Contact info available.** Check the About tab, description, or linked socials.

### Subscriber Tiers and What to Expect

| Subscribers | Response Rate | Likely Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 500 - 2K | High (30-50%) | Very responsive, eager for content ideas. May produce a dedicated video. |
| 2K - 10K | Medium (15-30%) | Good sweet spot. Enough audience to matter, small enough to care about pitches. |
| 10K - 50K | Low (5-15%) | May want compensation or affiliate deal. Worth pitching but set expectations. |
| 50K+ | Very low (<5%) | Long shot. Pitch anyway if highly relevant, but don't count on it. |

### Engagement Metrics to Check

- **Views per video:** More important than subscriber count. A 3K-sub channel with 5K views per video beats a 20K-sub channel with 200 views per video.
- **Comments per video:** 10+ comments suggests engaged audience. Read a few -- are they real questions or spam?
- **Upload frequency:** At least 1-2 videos per month means they're active.
- **Like ratio:** Visible on most videos. High likes relative to views = engaged audience.

### Strong Signals (Pitch These First)

- They've reviewed Etsy tools before (eRank, Marmalead, etc.)
- They do screen-share tutorials (your extension will look great in this format)
- They have links to tools in their video descriptions (open to promoting tools)
- They've done sponsored content before (understand the format)
- They reply to comments (engaged with their audience = more likely to reply to you)

### Red Flags (Skip These)

- No uploads in 6+ months
- Etsy content is a tiny fraction of their channel (they've moved on)
- Comment section is turned off
- All their tool recommendations are affiliate links with no genuine review
- They only post "Etsy is dead" or negative content

## Where to Find Contact Info

1. **YouTube About tab:** Click on the channel, go to "About." Many creators list a business email here (may require clicking "View email address").
2. **Video descriptions:** Some creators put their business email in every video description.
3. **Linked socials:** Check their Instagram, Twitter/X, or website linked on their channel.
4. **Their website:** If they link a website, check the contact page.
5. **Instagram DMs:** If email isn't available, a professional Instagram DM can work. Keep it brief.

**Do NOT pitch via YouTube comments.** It looks spammy and won't get a response.

## Building Your List

### Process

1. Run 3-5 search queries from the lists above on YouTube.
2. Sort results by "Upload date" to find active creators.
3. For each relevant channel, check: subscriber count, recent upload date, Etsy content focus.
4. Click to their About tab for contact info.
5. Add qualified channels to `tracking/tracker.csv`.
6. Aim for 8-10 qualified channels per research session.

### Prioritization Order

1. **Tier 1:** Channels that review Etsy tools. Use `youtuber-pitch.md` and emphasize the demo angle.
2. **Tier 2:** Etsy tutorial channels (SEO, listings, tags). Use `youtuber-pitch.md` and emphasize how the extension fits into their existing content.
3. **Tier 3:** General Etsy shop journey/income channels. Use `youtuber-pitch.md` and emphasize the "hidden tags reveal" as a content hook.
