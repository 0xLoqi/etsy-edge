## How to Evaluate if a Blog Is Worth Pitching

### Must-Have Criteria

- [ ] **Published in the last 12 months.** If their most recent Etsy post is from 2021, skip.
- [ ] **Has a contact email or contact form.** No way to reach them = no pitch.
- [ ] **Content is actually about Etsy selling.** Not just "I bought something on Etsy" posts.

### Strong Signals (Pitch These First)

- [ ] Multiple Etsy-focused posts (not just one)
- [ ] Comments or social shares on their posts (shows engaged audience)
- [ ] They review or recommend tools (means they're open to tool content)
- [ ] They have an email list or newsletter
- [ ] Domain Authority (DA) of 20+ (check with Moz free toolbar or Ubersuggest)
- [ ] They appear on page 1-2 of Google for Etsy-related queries

### Quick Traffic Check (Free Methods)

1. **SimilarWeb Chrome extension (free):** Install it, visit the blog, check estimated monthly visits. Target blogs with 1K-100K monthly visits.
2. **Ubersuggest (free tier):** Enter the blog URL to see estimated organic traffic and top pages.
3. **Google "site:theirblog.com etsy":** Count how many Etsy-related pages are indexed. More = better.
4. **Check their social media followers.** Even rough numbers help gauge audience size.

### Red Flags (Skip These)

- No posts in 12+ months
- Blog is clearly abandoned (broken images, expired SSL)
- Content is thin or AI-generated filler
- No way to contact them
- They only write negative/complaint posts about Etsy

## Where to Find Contact Info

1. **About page:** Most bloggers list their email on their About or Contact page.
2. **Contact form:** If no email, use their contact form. Same pitch, slightly shorter.
3. **Footer:** Some sites put email addresses in the footer.
4. **Social media bios:** Check their Twitter/X, Instagram, or LinkedIn for email or DM option.
5. **Hunter.io (free tier):** Enter their domain to find associated email addresses.
6. **WHOIS lookup:** Sometimes the domain registration has a contact email (less common now with privacy protection).

## Building Your List

### Process

1. Run 3-5 search queries from the lists above.
2. Open each relevant result in a new tab.
3. Spend 2-3 minutes per blog: check recency, relevance, and traffic.
4. If it passes the Must-Have criteria, add to `tracking/tracker.csv`.
5. Find their email and note which template to use.
6. Aim for 10-15 qualified blogs per research session.

### Prioritization Order

1. **Tier 1:** Blogs that already review Etsy tools or have roundup posts. Use `roundup-pitch.md`.
2. **Tier 2:** Active Etsy tip blogs with engaged audiences. Use `blogger-pitch.md`.
3. **Tier 3:** General ecommerce blogs that occasionally cover Etsy. Use `blogger-pitch.md` with extra context about why their audience would care.
