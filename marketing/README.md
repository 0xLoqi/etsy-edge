# Etsy Edge — Marketing & Launch Plan

## Overview
Everything you need to launch and grow Etsy Edge. All content is ready-to-paste — just replace `[placeholders]` with real values.

## Placeholders to Replace
- `[your-email]` → Your contact email
- `#` (Chrome Web Store links) → Actual store URL once published
- `[link]` → Chrome Web Store URL

## Key Principles
1. **Value first, tool second.** Every post should be useful even if no one clicks the link.
2. **Not spam.** One mention per thread. No mass posting. Genuine engagement.
3. **Free tier is the funnel.** Tag Spy (free) gets installs. Some fraction converts to Pro.
4. **Consistency > intensity.** 30 min/day of genuine engagement beats a one-day blitz.
5. **Track everything.** Know which channels drive installs. Double down on what works.
